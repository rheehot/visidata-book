# Column layout

## `_`

`g_` to expand all columns.
`z_`
`gz_`

`-`
`z-`


## `gv` to unhide all hidden columns

- set width to `options.default_width` on all hidden columns

## `v`

On most sheets, by default, each row takes up one line on the screen.
In VisiData 2.x, `v` toggles the height between 1 and 10 for all visible columns.
column.height indicates how many lines each row is allowed to take up, if its value is too wide for the column, and can be word-wrapped for better visibility.
So this is the fastest way to enable multiline rows.

`zv` will toggle the height similarly, for the cursor column.

## ColumnsSheet

Of course you can go to the ColumnsSheet and edit the height there.
By default the `height` column is not visible (perhaps this should change).
Make it visible with `gv` and then edit the `height` values to set the maximum number of lines a row can use to make each column more visible.

## `v`
- column visibility: toggles column.height between 1 and 10 on all visible columns.

## Multi-line rows
